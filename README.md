# Introduction

This repository contains firmware for a pickup winder based on a Ramps 1.4 board, RepRadDiscount Full Graphics Smart Controller, a stepper motor, a servo and an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller board.

# Installation

- Assemble the pickup winder as can be seen in the picture below
- Use e.g. the Arduino IDE to flash the sketch in the src/ directory to the Mega 2560

# Usage

- Press the encoder button on the display to enter/leave a setting
- Rotate the encoder to change a setting. Since the display is so godawfully slow the code waits for a timeout until updating the display.
- Press the STOP button on the display to start the winding process
- Press the STOP button to stop the winding process, too ;)
